# ColorMag Pro Child Theme
A  Child Theme for ColorMag Pro

Many of us want to customize something in theme. Are you also looking to add or edit something in the theme that you are using? If yes, then you have come to the right place, my friend. This post is a simple and comprehensive tutorial on creating a WordPress child theme.

If the theme has lots of customization options then this might help fulfill your needs. But regardless of how many options may be available, there can still be something that the current theme you have is unable to do or is not the way you like. So, if you are comfortable with codes and WordPress then you may dive into the theme files and start editing it spending some minutes, hours to add the changes that you like into the theme, only to discover you have lost those changes when your theme’s next update rolls around.

So to avoid this comes our hero called the Child Theme. Creating a child theme allows you to make changes to your site without changing anything in the original theme’s code. Even if you’re only making a few minor tweaks, it pays to spend a few minutes creating a child theme.
